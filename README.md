# project overview
This project the concept of community is explored with written word. In this project the lines of "Everybody Loves the Sunshine" by Maurice Green & Roy Ayers are translated into an interactive experience. The key of this project is to use advanced css layout (flexbox and positioning) with interaction techniques (hover effects, transformations, translations, and animations). It is also about using typography to make imagery combined with creative and conceptual thinking to produce an engaging website.

The connection to sunny days and the emotions they evoke extends beyond just personal experiences. It resonates deeply with the broader concept of community across different cultures. Sunny days have a universal appeal, symbolizing hope, joy, and renewal. In many societies, they serve as catalysts for communal activities, from neighborhood barbecues to street festivals, where people come together to celebrate life and each other's company. The warmth of the sun can be metaphorical too, representing solidarity and support within communities facing adversity. Just as the sun's rays can pierce through clouds, bringing light to darkness, collective efforts and shared experiences can illuminate paths toward positive change. In cities like Los Angeles, where diversity is celebrated and resilience is paramount, the metaphorical sunshine becomes a powerful force, fostering unity and resilience in the face of challenges. The imagery of skateboarding under the bright sun speaks to my youth and the freedom. It's a reminder that even in urban landscapes, where concrete jungles may seem cold and impersonal, there are moments of warmth and connection waiting to be discovered. Through shared activities like skateboarding, I have forge bonds that transcend boundaries, uniting in a shared sense of belonging and camaraderie. This song serves as a poignant reminder that amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life, there are moments of beauty and togetherness to be found. It encapsulates the essence of community, highlighting the transformative power of simple pleasures and shared experiences in fostering peace and harmony, even if only for a fleeting moment.

CURRENT STATUS = 90% Completed

I utilized the Visual Studio Code application to develop this website, coding both HTML and CSS components. The site's structure involves multiple folders, with each folder dedicated to a specific page. Within each folder, there is an HTML file corresponding to that page, featuring links to navigate sequentially through the site. A single CSS file is employed for the entire website, linked to each HTML page. This CSS file contains comment lines separating the CSS code for different pages. Additionally, JavaScript functionality was integrated directly into the HTML files, housed within a dedicated "JS" folder.
